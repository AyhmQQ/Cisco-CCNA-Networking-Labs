# Lab 02 – Device Connectivity and Network Layout

## Overview
This lab focuses on connecting networking devices and building a structured multi-router topology as part of my Cisco CCNA (200-301) studies.

The objective is to understand proper physical connections between routers, switches, and end devices, and to design a scalable network layout.

## Objectives
- Connect multiple routers using appropriate interfaces
- Connect switches to routers and end devices
- Understand link distances and network segmentation
- Build a structured hierarchical network layout

## Devices Used
- Multiple Router-PT devices
- Switch-PT devices
- PCs and Server
- Various copper connections

## Notes
This lab focuses on device connectivity and topology structure. IP addressing and routing configuration will be implemented in later labs.
