# Lab 02 – Device Connectivity and Cable Selection

## Overview
This lab focuses on understanding how to properly connect networking devices using the correct cable types in Packet Tracer as part of my Cisco CCNA (200-301) studies.

The objective is to learn how different network devices should be physically connected and to identify when to use straight-through, cross-over, or fiber connections.

## Objectives
- Connect Router to Router
- Connect Router to Switch
- Connect Switch to Switch
- Connect PC to Switch
- Select the correct cable type for each connection


## Devices Used
- Router-PT devices
- Switch-PT devices
