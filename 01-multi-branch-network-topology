# Lab 01 – Multi-Branch Network Topology

## Overview
This lab focuses on building a basic multi-branch enterprise network topology in Packet Tracer as part of my Cisco CCNA (200-301) studies.

The objective was to understand network layout, device placement, and logical structure of branch-based enterprise networks.

## Objectives
- Place routers, switches, and end devices
- Design a multi-branch topology
- Simulate an internet segment
- Understand basic enterprise network structure

## Devices Used
- Cisco 2911 Routers
- Cisco 2960 Switches
- Firewall devices
- PCs and Servers
- Simulated ISP router

## Notes
This lab focuses on topology design only. IP addressing, routing configuration, and connectivity testing will be implemented in future labs.
